A looping function is more memory efficient than a recursive function call,
because at each step of a recursive call, the function is added to the top of
the call stack. If your function needs to recurse 500 times to work correctly,
there will be 500 instances of the function on the call stack. In contrast, an
iterative function will only be placed on the call stack once.
