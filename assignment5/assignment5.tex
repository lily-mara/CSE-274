  \section{Binary Search Trees}

  A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree in which each node is larger than
  the nodes in its left subtree and smaller than the nodes in its right
  subtree. It is also sometimes called an Ordered Binary Tree.

  \subsection{The Good}

  In theory, non-balancing Binary Search Trees should perform
  find/add/remove operations in $\Theta \left( log \left( n \right)
  \right)$ time when balanced. This is due to the fact that to perform any
  of these functions, you must visit at most $tree.height$ items, and
  a balanced Binary Search Tree has height $log \left( n \right)$. When
  traversing a Binary Search Tree, you can use the ``small on left, large
  on right'' property of Binary Search trees to compare the expected
  element to the current one, and it will only have to visit $\Theta
  \left( log \left( n \right) \right)$ items.

  \subsection{The Bad}

  In practice, it is very easy to create a Binary Search Tree that is
  unbalanced, and as a result has a complexity of $\Theta \left(
  n \right)$. In fact, of all of the data structures tested, the
  non-balancing Binary Search Tree had the worst performance scores.

      Operation & Time (ms) \\
      \hline
      Random Add & 83285 \\
      Random Find & 5 \\
      Random Remove & 8 \\
      Sequential Add & 127144 \\
      Sequential Find & 114062 \\
      Sequential Remove & 41 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

  \section{Red-Black Trees}

  A Red-Black Tree is a kind of Binary Search Tree that balances itself as
  elements are added to it.

  \subsection{The Good}

  The Red-Black Tree is significantly faster than the Binary Search Tree
  in testing because it is self balancing. This means that as elements are
  added to the Red-Black Tree, it corrects for the order of the elements
  automatically in an attempt to keep the complexity as low as possible.
  The Red Black Tree has a maximum complexity of $\Theta \left( 2 log
  \left( n \right) \right)$.
